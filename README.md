# Weather App

The Weather App is a cross-platform mobile application built using Flutter and Dart, demonstrating a solid understanding of modern mobile app development principles. This project showcases proficiency in creating applications with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, making API calls, and integrating device location services. The app provides real-time weather updates for any city worldwide or based on the user's current location, all presented with a simple and intuitive user interface.

## Features

* City-Based Weather Search: Users can enter any city name to receive real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief weather description.
* Current Location Weather: Utilizes the device's GPS to provide weather data for the user's current location.
* User-Friendly UI: Designed with a clean and minimalistic user interface for a seamless user experience.
* MVVM Architecture: Ensures a clear separation of concerns, enhancing code maintainability and testability.
* State Management with Provider: Uses the Provider package for efficient state management.
* API Integration: Fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Technologies and Skills Demonstrated

* Flutter & Dart: Showcases the ability to create performant, cross-platform mobile applications.
* State Management: Efficient state management using the Provider package.
* Networking: Fetching and parsing JSON data from an external API using the http package.
* Geolocation: Integrates the location package to access the device's GPS and fetch weather data based on geographical coordinates.
* MVVM Architecture: Ensures a modular and maintainable codebase by implementing the MVVM architectural pattern.
* Asynchronous Programming: Efficient handling of asynchronous operations and API calls in Dart.

## Future Improvements

* Hourly and Weekly Forecast: Extend the app to provide detailed hourly and weekly weather forecasts.
* Weather Alerts: Implement notifications for severe weather alerts.
* Enhanced UI/UX: Continuously improve the user interface and experience based on user feedback.
